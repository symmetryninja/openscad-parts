# OpenSCAD parts

## Purpose
This repo started out as a way to share code across my robotics projects and turned into something quite a lot more complex.

It came about because I typically model my robots all in one scad file and I use scripting to render multiple seperate parts. Included in all of my model files are the non-3d printed parts, components, servos, batteries etc, this helps me build things to the right scale - even though it's kinda nuts.

## Usage

1. Clone down the repo
2. Add the repo to the OpenSCAD path [instructions here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Libraries#Setting_OPENSCADPATH) you can use powershell:
    ```powershell
    # from https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/03/powershell-environment-variables/
    # in a non elevated shell
    $openscad_parts_path = 'C:\path-to\openscad-parts'
    [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENSCADPATH',$openscad_parts_path,[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
    ```

3. include the `sn_tools.scad` meta-import file like this:
    ```c
    include <sn_tools.scad>

    // your awesome code here
    ```
4. Endlessly search through this tools code in the hope to find something useful
5. Use the code.

## A quick example

```c
// Lets say I want to create a centered cube:
cube_size = [20, 20, 20];
ccube(cube_size);

// Now I want to:
// - put the cube at [30, 30, 30]
// - create a cube in the same place but down 15
// - mirror the cube on the XY & Z axis

cube_offset = [30, 30, 30];

mirrorX() mirrorY() mirrorZ()
translate(cube_offset)
ccube(cube_size);

// Next, I want to put 8 cubes of different sizes in a cube layout and hull the links between but not the whole thing
cube_sizes = [[10, 10, 10], [14, 14, 14], [12, 12, 12], [19, 19, 19], [12, 12, 12], [14, 14, 14], [15, 15, 15], [13, 13, 13], [17, 17, 17], ];
cube_offsets = [ [20, 20, 20], [20, -20, 20], [20, -20, -20], [20, 20, -20], [-20, 20, 20], [-20, -20, 20], [-20, 20, -20], [-20, -20, -20], ];

progressive_hull() {
    translate(cube_offsets[0]) ccube(cube_sizes[0]);
    translate(cube_offsets[1]) ccube(cube_sizes[1]);
    translate(cube_offsets[2]) ccube(cube_sizes[2]);
    translate(cube_offsets[3]) ccube(cube_sizes[3]);
    translate(cube_offsets[4]) ccube(cube_sizes[4]);
    translate(cube_offsets[5]) ccube(cube_sizes[5]);
    translate(cube_offsets[6]) ccube(cube_sizes[6]);
    translate(cube_offsets[7]) ccube(cube_sizes[7]);
    translate(cube_offsets[0]) ccube(cube_sizes[0]);
}

// lastly, a sphere multiplied in a cube layout with the links between them hulled

progressive_hull_at_locations(locations = cube_offsets) csphere(d=8);

```
